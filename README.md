## Project Setup

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# Create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Edit the `/src/routes/+page.svelte` file and save the changes to see them reflected on the webpage.
